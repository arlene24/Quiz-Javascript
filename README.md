# Quiz Javascript 
This is my second Project

## I have used in this project:

- Html 
- Css 
- Javascript

## Overview

In this program, there are three layers or boxes, and these boxes shown one by one on a particular button clicked. At first, on the webpage, there is shown a button labeled as “Start Quiz” and when you clicked on that button, then the info box appears with popup animation.

In this infobox, there are some rules of the quiz and two buttons labeled as “Exit” and “Continue”. When you clicked on the Exit button, the info box will be hidden but when you clicked on the Continue button, then the Quiz Box appears.

I have added different html pages to add questions. 

<h3>What I have Learned:</h3>

I have learned how to connect different pages in one page. I have learned more deeply javascrit after facing a lot of difficulties. 

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about javascript as I have enjoyed learning on my own new things in this project. 

### Usefull resourses
